As an initial step toward building a recommendation system, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques** were applied to uncover hidden patterns in user-movie interactions.
PCA helps reduce dimensionality while preserving key information, allowing for more efficient analysis.
Clustering techniques, such as **K-Means** or **Hierarchical Clustering**, enable us to group similar users or movies based on their rating behaviors.
These techniques lay the groundwork for future recommendation models by identifying meaningful structures within the data.
